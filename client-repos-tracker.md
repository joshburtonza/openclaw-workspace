## HOW THIS WORKS

Every Tuesday morning before emails:
1. Pull latest from all three repos
2. Compare commits since last sync
3. Note what features/fixes/changes shipped
4. Update this file with summary
5. Post to Discord in #📄-documents
6. Sophia reads it before responding to clients (so she understands what's new)
