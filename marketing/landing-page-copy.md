## PROBLEM

**Section heading:**
You're not overwhelmed. You're under-systemised.

**Body:**
Most founders use AI like a search engine. Ask it a question, get an answer, move on. The business still runs on you — your attention, your drafts, your decisions, your inbox.

That's not a people problem. It's an infrastructure problem.

AI tools are powerful. But they wait to be used. An operating system runs whether you're there or not.

---

## SOLUTION

**Section heading:**
Four layers. One system.

---

**Layer 1 — Intelligence**

*Icon: brain / signal*

**Heading:** Know what matters before your day starts.

Every article, transcript, and meeting note goes into a processing pipeline. The AI extracts strategic insights, identifies gaps, and delivers a morning brief to your phone at 7am.

You drop the input. The system delivers the intelligence.

---

**Layer 2 — Communication**

*Icon: message / envelope*

**Heading:** Drafts ready. You approve. Nothing goes out without you.

Sophia — your AI email agent — reads every inbound message and drafts the response. You see a queue. One tap: approve, hold, or reject.

Email response time drops from hours to minutes. You never write a first draft again.

---

**Layer 3 — Operations**

*Icon: code / gear*

**Heading:** Queue a task. Wake up to a commit.

Send a Telegram message describing what needs to change. The system pulls the code, reads the client context, implements, and pushes. You review the result.

Development tasks ship autonomously. Your attention goes to the decisions, not the execution.

---

**Layer 4 — Visibility**

*Icon: dashboard / eye*

**Heading:** Always know what the system is doing.

Mission Control is your real-time operations surface. Email queue, agent health, pending approvals, and a kill switch. If anything breaks, you're alerted within 10 minutes.

Full control without full attention.

---

## PROOF

**Section heading:**
We built it for ourselves first.

**Body:**
Amalfi AI runs on Amalfi OS.

Our client emails go through Sophia. Our code ships through the task worker. Our morning brief lands at 7am. If something breaks, we know before the client does.

We are the first client. Not because we had to be — because we'd never sell something we weren't living in.

**Pull quote:**
*"The system handled three client email threads overnight, shipped a code fix, and had a brief ready when I woke up. I spent the morning on strategy."*
— Josh Burton, Founder, Amalfi AI

## HOW IT WORKS

**Section heading:**
From audit to running system in two weeks.

**Steps:**

**1. Audit (Week 1)**
We map your operations. Where time is lost. Where decisions stack up. Where manual work is replaceable. You get a clear picture of what the build looks like before we start.

**2. Build & Configure (Week 1–2)**
We configure Amalfi OS to your business — your email tone, your repos, your team structure, your tools. No generic setup. Everything is specific to how you operate.

**3. Hand-off & Infrastructure**
We deploy Mission Control on your domain, configure your Telegram gateway, and hand you the keys. We stay on as your AI infrastructure team. The system evolves as your business does.

## WHAT YOU'RE NOT GETTING

- Not a SaaS subscription you have to learn
- Not a virtual assistant checking a shared inbox
- Not ChatGPT with a company name on it
- Not a black box — everything is visible, auditable, and stoppable

## CTA

**Section heading:**
3 spots. Q1 2026.

**Body:**
We work with a small number of founder-led businesses at a time. Not because of capacity — because configuration takes focus and we don't cut corners.

If your business has a team of 1–15 people and you're ready to stop being the bottleneck:

Applications take 5 minutes. We'll respond within 48 hours.

*Design notes:*
- *Dark theme (navy/slate + electric accent). Minimal. Not SaaS-y.*
- *Hero needs one strong visual — Mission Control screenshot or Telegram brief screenshot*
- *Layer cards should feel like a product, not a feature list*
- *Mobile-first — this will be read on phones*
