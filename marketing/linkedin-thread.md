# Amalfi OS — LinkedIn Thread

**Format:** 8 posts. Post 1 is the hook. Posts 2–7 build the story. Post 8 is the CTA.
**Tone:** Founder-to-founder. Specific, not hype. Show the real system.

## Post 1 — Hook

We built an AI operating system for our own business.

Not a chatbot.
Not an assistant.
Not prompts bolted onto Notion.

An actual operating layer that runs research, emails clients, ships code, and reports to us every morning.

We're using it right now. Here's exactly how it works:

## Post 2 — The Problem

Most businesses use AI the same way they use Google.

Ask a question. Get an answer. Move on. Nothing in the business actually changes.

That's not wrong — but it's leaving 90% of the value on the table.

The real leverage isn't answering questions.
It's replacing the workflows that eat your day.

The difference: a tool waits to be used. An operating system runs whether you're there or not.

## Post 3 — Layer 1: Intelligence

Every morning at 7am, a brief arrives in our Telegram.

It covers:
– What happened in our client repos overnight
– How many emails are waiting for approval
– Strategic intel extracted from research we dropped the day before

We don't read articles to stay sharp. We drop them into a pipeline. The AI reads them overnight, extracts what's relevant, flags gaps in our thinking, and creates tasks to close them.

We start the day knowing what matters. Without reading anything.

## Post 4 — Layer 2: Communication

We have an AI called Sophia.

Sophia reads every inbound client email and drafts the response. We see the draft in a dashboard. One tap: approve, hold, or reject.

She has never sent an email without a human checkpoint.

But we've cut email response time from hours to minutes — and we never write the first draft.

The queue is visible in real-time. If something comes in overnight, the draft is ready when we wake up.

## Post 5 — Layer 3: Operations

Last week I sent this Telegram message:

"Update the payment redirect flow in the Chrome Auto Care app — Yoco webhook is sending to the wrong page."

The system:
1. Pulled the latest code from the repo
2. Read a context file with everything it needs to know about that client (tech stack, contacts, current focus)
3. Implemented the fix
4. Committed and pushed

I reviewed the commit. I didn't write a line.

That's not the future. That's Tuesday.

## Post 6 — Layer 4: Visibility

There's a dashboard we call Mission Control.

Real-time view of:
– Email queue (pending, approved, sent)
– Agent health (19 automated processes, all monitored)
– Pending approvals
– Kill switch (one button to pause outbound communication)

If any part of the system breaks, an error monitor catches it and sends a Telegram alert within 10 minutes.

The system is always transparent. We always know what it's doing and why.

## Post 7 — The Proof

We are the first client.

Amalfi AI runs on Amalfi OS. Our client emails go through Sophia. Our repo work runs through the task worker. Our morning brief lands at 7am.

We built it for ourselves before we built it for anyone else — because if it doesn't work for us, it doesn't work.

This thread was written inside the system. Posted by a human. Built by a team of one AI and one founder.

---

## Post 8 — CTA

We're taking on 3 businesses in Q1.

Not SaaS. We build it, configure it to your business, and stay on as your AI infrastructure team. You get the keys.

If you're running a founder-led business and you're tired of being the bottleneck:

DM me "OS" and we'll talk.
