## What It Is

Amalfi OS is an AI operating system built and configured specifically for your business. It replaces manual operational workflows — email drafting, research processing, code delivery, reporting — with a system that runs autonomously and keeps you in control of every output.

You don't learn new software. You get a running system.

---

## What You Get

**Sophia — AI Email Agent**
Sophia reads every inbound email and drafts the response. You see a queue in the Mission Control dashboard. One tap: approve, hold, or reject. Nothing goes out without you — but you never write the first draft.

*Impact: Email response time drops from hours to minutes.*

---

**Research & Intelligence Pipeline**
Drop articles, transcripts, meeting notes, or URLs into a pipeline. The AI processes them overnight and delivers a morning brief with strategic insights and recommended actions — to your phone, every morning at 7am.

*Impact: You start every day knowing what matters, without reading anything.*

---

**Autonomous Task Worker**
Send a message describing work that needs to be done. The system reads the relevant context, implements it, and notifies you when it's done. You review the output — not the process.

*Impact: Operational tasks ship without manual execution.*

---

**Mission Control Dashboard**
Real-time visibility across the entire system. Email queue, agent health, pending approvals, system alerts. One kill switch to pause all outbound communication instantly.

*Impact: Full control without full attention.*

---

**Telegram Gateway**
A direct line from you to your AI brain. Create tasks, book calendar events, approve emails, query system state — all from one Telegram message. Your interface to everything.

*Impact: One message = work done.*

---

## What Changes

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| Drafting every client email manually | Queue of pre-drafted responses, approve in seconds |
| Research piling up unread | Morning brief with extracted insights, delivered |
| Chasing team / tools for updates | Mission Control: full picture in one screen |
| Work blocked when you're unavailable | System runs autonomously, notifies you of outcomes |
| Decisions scattered across apps | One Telegram interface for tasks, events, approvals |

## How We Work Together

**Week 1 — Audit & Design**
We map your operations. Where time is lost, where decisions stack up, where manual work is replaceable. You get a clear picture of the build before we start.

**Weeks 1–2 — Build & Configure**
We configure Amalfi OS to your business: email tone, team structure, tools, client context. Everything specific to how you operate.

**Ongoing — Infrastructure Partnership**
We deploy, hand you the keys, and stay on as your AI infrastructure team. The system evolves as the business does.

## Investment

## Why Amalfi AI

We run Amalfi OS ourselves. Our client emails go through Sophia. Our code ships through the task worker. Our morning brief lands at 7am. We are the first client.

We don't sell what we haven't built for ourselves.
