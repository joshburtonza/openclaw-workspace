This is an example of how a blood must look like. These are two samples of healthy blood. There are only two different fields. One is a light field and the other is a dark field. The white blood cells are the ones you see here. They don't see us in every scale. The ratio between red blood cells and white blood cells is 600-1000-1. The difference between blood analysis and a lab like AMPA, which is what I use, is that when you draw blood, you mix it with an anti-degenerative substance, like chemicals, otherwise it will stop. I take capillary blood, they take blood from the ears. So there are two different techniques. It doesn't discredit each other. There is no other way to look at it. We will look at your blood on the screen. Let's go. That looks crazy. Is it healthy? Yes, it is definitely healthy. But I don't know. Let's see what happens. Okay, it concerns me. Yes. Your ears are open. What affects your ears? There are a few things I can think of. Elasticity, which is a result of high insulin. Insulin can definitely... I thought I had high insulin. Because I got skin tags. Ah, okay. So I assumed there was some sort of insulin intolerance or something happening there. Yes, very smart. My people know that it is a drop-out. A drop-out with skin tags is insulin. But what I see here is an intravascular blood clot. So I am very happy to see this. We are going to extract this blood from your ears. Intravascular blood? Yes, intravascular blood clots. You are not going to see this in a conventional way. Because you have broken up these clots. This is what happens to your ears. I am doing a cloning test. I am not saying that the microscope says it for us. Or that the retinal says it for us. But I mean, you have seen on the polysynthesis. Ears were your biggest reaction. You reacted with your own. Actually, your bacteria are very good. But these are definitely going to cause scurvy and problems in your ears. Your blood is not thick. Your blood is thin. Oh, sick. It is cool. Your claim is that you have seen a few loose clots. But we are going to remove these too. What happens to my ears? What do you do? What causes it? Capillary changes. In your heart, your brain, your lungs. When you go through your ears and spread them out, they get smaller and smaller. When you look at your ears, there is a thick stem. There is a small, fine, thick stem. This is a capillary vessel. What is in your brain, your heart, this is already thick. Until it is so small, small, small. That is only 4 microns wide. That is the width of a red blood cell. That can also come in. But you can put that in your ear. Oh, stretching. Yes, yes, yes. You know, as I said, it is not ideal that it is there. I am not physically scared. I am happy to see it. I know how to loosen it. But you can't loosen it there. Thank you for coming. Let us examine this. This type of intravascular is a micro blood clot. That is what it is. That is another description for it. I have never seen that. I have never seen that. In my literature, when I was studying at London University, all my colleagues, they are very honest, they teach us about micro blood clots. But we don't really see it. We have never seen it. Until I met Kaubert and Kaubert and Spike. Then Spike came back. Then Stethos came back. What he did was... I could not understand what he was doing. Why did he look like that? Until I talked to Dr. Fakhria at the Biochemical Institute. She said, it is all about the polarity. I said, that makes sense. It means the charge. He emitted the charge around the red blood cell. It is like a cell magnet. It is positive and negative. It hits each other, attracts each other. Our blood has it too. So that it does not stuck to each other. But here it is like the cell membrane is disintegrated. It is actually super scary. But yes, now we are older. Five years later we know what to do. And now we have to get rid of it. But it is thinking and fanatical computing. The nice thing is, it adapts to the time. Around the time, there is a typical spike. There is also a contamination. You know, from other people too. There is a massive clump. Yes, and there is still energy. Ok, so let us get rid of it. We are going to do it. Ok. Is it a teammate? Or is it a fight fight? Wow. Ok. Ok, so someone who does I do not know I do not know if you know my mom's story about her pulmonary embolism. So she had COVID but it did not spread. Because of what that embolism can cause. How big it is versus how small it is. Are we there? Are we not there? Are we same neighbours? Are we a whatsapp group? Yes, you are a dad. Oh, fuck me. Ok. People who have a pulmonary embolism sometimes use it to stop the blood flow. So they ask if they can stop the blood flow. I can show you how to stop it. I can show you how it should look like. So you can see what it looks like. What is that? That is a sour crystal. You have not told me reflux. Reflux. That is a sour crystal. Ok. So I will tell you. This person was very sick. They were put in a wheelchair. And that was 5.1 of the opium treatment. I have many friends based on many other patients and many other people So that is all wrong? Yes. It is a pity to condemn you. But you are more vulnerable to it. The spike protein in you is very terrible. It is in your genetic code. It is also in your family. Did you tell this to my brother? I can not tell you that. If I had, I would tell you. What you keep is that you have a few loose strands. That is the problem. You will not find out that it is not a thing. Many times people say that they feel tired. I don't think so. I don't sleep much. My energy stays the same. I can sleep 3 hours I can get 12 hours of sleep. Does that mean that my chest is stiff? Does that mean that my heart and lungs are stiff? Yes. I can feel it when I sit. Does that mean that my heart and lungs are stiff? But it is not something you are used to. You are not getting rid of it. You don't have enough oxygen in your heart and lungs. And your capillaries are not functioning. Sick. Yes. Yes. No. No. No. I am so... But you told me that you laugh when you are drunk. Yes, but she said that I was like a rebel. Yes. I laugh when I am drunk. I can make you drunk. You can drink another drink. She had a vegetable juice. Okay. Everything is in your gut. All of your receptors for serotonin are in your gut. That is what motivates you and makes you feel happy. You like to sleep deep. You like to use serotonin to make melatonin. You like to sleep deep. I think that my energy stays the same when I drink a few drinks. It is fantastic. But the problem is that it is not sustainable. There is a reason for that. You are talking about a story. Okay, I can see what is going on. Let's go to the front. Come with me. I can show you. What is going on? It is like you are very concentrated. That is what I want to do to you. It is literally your gut and your blood. Okay. It is easier if I give you a lot of pills for this and that. If I don't get your blood right and your gut right then you won't function properly. Come with me. This is not a PCR test. It is a blood pressure test. I want to test your insulin. When do you want to talk? What do you want to talk about? My stomach. My arms hurt. It is a small stomach ache. Okay, so you know what it is. Then your muscles start to break. Your arms and your legs start to break. Your muscles and all your muscles start to break. Okay, so tell us about your insulin. What do you want to talk to us about? I think I have a lot of weight. My skull is bigger than my head. It is a joke. It is funny. I haven't seen it yet. I have a very big child. So I am afraid of heights. Okay, but let's get straight to it. So this thrombocyte aggregation Can it be that you obviously see a lot of adrenaline. That is something I thought about when I drove here. So there are a lot of adrenaline spikes in your environment. Is it that I actually No, no. It can also be because normal people have a lot of responsibility. A man with a child. Then you have a lot of responsibility. You have to understand yourself. So you have a lot of responsibility. So definitely with that you will have a lot of adrenaline. It is not just the motorbikes. Okay, I just thought it is something you can see immediately. Sure. Okay, when do you say I accumulate adrenaline? Sir, when your insulin is low. Because now you don't burn fat and energy. Then you have to accumulate your body on the other side. Then you say, either adrenaline or I go to the psychiatrist or I drink Red Bull. But the problem is, then your insulin stays low for four days. Then your muscles start to burn. Mad. Okay. Now, if I look at you, it looks like you are a veteran. Your adrenaline is at 222. You have to do 80. Yes. Cool. I can actually see your day-to-day stress is mine. By a man. I don't stress about life. Not at all. But not at all. Because your two activating hormones, your CRF, your Ketotropic Releasing Factor, your OCD, that is what activates your adrenaline. When you are stressed every day, when you worry about the smallest things, you get something to worry about. You are not one of those people. But your destroyed adrenaline is very high. So your accumulator of adrenaline is high. Great. It means my tolerance is high. I won't give you anything. I won't give you a bowl. I think it's okay. I will get your immune system back. I will release the clones. And your gut. So you are 80 now. Yes. Out of curiosity, stay away from Red Bull, stay away from caffeine and coffee. Is it bad? No, caffeine is good. But proper coffee. Filtered coffee is no problem. Instant coffee sounds disgusting. Caffeine is good for us. We don't need that. We drink sugar and that's it. If you go from sugar free Red Bull or sugar free filtered coffee, you drink half a sugar. Does that effect get you away from Red Bull? Definitely. Red Bull has a lot of other toxins. And if you want to burn fat for energy, to keep my patience I learned how to burn fat for energy. Not weight loss. Because if you lose weight, you burn fat. You get fat. Especially if people are on an extreme diet, I won't be a problem in the short term. Because now you have less calories. But you are in a crisis. Your body says, I will never gain weight again. The body doesn't count the calories. It's a human being. It's not a body. It doesn't count the calories. You can eat as much as you want. You can eat as much as you want. But it's what you eat. It's all about insulin. I used to do it for myself. My insulin was 64. I gave you insulin. Which is relatively normal. What is normal? Well, you don't burn fat when it's under 6. Yours was 64? Yes, but my liver broke down in a car accident. So my receptors for insulin worked. But if I was on an extreme diet, I wouldn't be able to get my insulin back. And it did. My doctor took my insulin back from 64 to 5.5. I didn't know it was 20 kilograms. So the problem is that my body broke down. So it was overworked. But I broke down. My heart also broke down. So I was in a difficult situation. I'm not someone who talks on a bandwagon. So before I started I looked at the doctors. I looked at the patients. I looked at their reports. I followed them for 6 months. People who have been on a diet for 10, 15, 20 years have a longer life span. And a shorter life span. So when I get my insulin back I don't want to lose any more weight. So I start eating sweet potatoes. I eat a sweet potato once in 4 days. My husband tells me that I look like a beginner. So I tell him that it's the same way. But before that I didn't gain any weight. If I gain 2 kilograms then I don't gain weight. So I lost a lot of insulin. The problem with insulin is that everything else has grown. You know, you told us that you don't want to lose weight. But the problem with insulin is that you get Alzheimer's, dementia, Parkinson's, diabetes, heart conditions. Yes, I don't want to lose any more weight. So how do you get that? I look at a lot of people and I don't know if that's what I should do. Well, most people don't want to lose weight. If you don't want to lose weight, then why do you want to lose weight? For me, it's easier to lose weight than to gain weight. I don't give a lot of reasons. I have my oesophagus and my half of my oesophagus normal for the first time because I actually bought meat. Meat also has all your vitamins and minerals. You don't really need to eat a lot of meat. So if you want to be all positive, then you have to eat pasta. I told my wife that the food program was a lobby program where the Americans lobbied to get more sales in the agricultural sector. It's not really a scientific thing. It's not. Strictly not. I can honestly say from my own experience that carnivore is my life. Yes, yes, yes. For many of my other patients, if someone says to me, can a carnivore do it? Then I say yes. The only thing I don't want to say about carnivores is that they want to. Because they are carcinogenic, they are high in flammatory. Yes, I can tolerate a little bit. But I will drink milk with the liter. With the liter. No, no, because you can also make alcohol that will be very good for you. The other thing I also want to say is in terms of your reflux. Is that when you actually have sugar and salt and gluten, then it actually makes you. It is one of the main factors. It is a major factor. But you will also find that carnivores are getting better. But then you have to work on sugar. So if you say what you want for me, sugar and salt and gluten. Look, if you are a carnivore, then you cut an apple with all these foods. But if you can say to people, these are good foods to cheat on. So if you are going to cheat on something, then you have to eat a potato. No, not bread. Then you eat a potato. Do you understand? Or you eat a sweet potato. Fantastic. I'm going to tell you this. I am a student. I still ate your Nova chocolate. If you like chocolate, Nova. So we have it here. You spell it L-I-N-T-E-R. N-O-V-E-R. Well, Gluten. L-I-N-T-E-R. This app is on board. If you download the app, you have to set up exactly what I say there. They give all the meals you can eat. I'm going to give you insulin friendly diet programs. Because if you follow that, you will burn fat. But if you are a carnivore, then you have a lot of gold for it. The best thing to get insulin under control is to do intermittent fasting. You are welcome to do that too. You eat portions of brunch and dinner. Most people do that. But it is more important what you eat. The best thing I can imagine is that you do a fast. You can still drink coffee. You have water, of course black. But within 48 hours, you have burned all the sugar in your liver. Isn't that amazing? You propel yourself forward. So black coffee for 3 days. I want to be as aggressive as possible today. I just got a call. I'm not coming to the Netherlands anymore. Exactly, I understand. You save yourself a lot of energy. I don't want to hear you do intermittent fasting. You can do 2 or 3 meals a day. The best start of your day is to eat eggs. It is the best breakfast. No bread, no carbohydrates. Just omelette with bacon and mushroom. The other thing that helps me a lot is that I have 2 routines. I eat eggs and steak. Then I eat eggs because it is difficult for me. Eggs and a choppy. Not to separate the eggs. If I don't want to eat something, I eat ava. Ava and rocket. That hasn't been a problem for me. If you need a little bit of sugar, then I eat a little bit of chocolate. Can you tell me when you have a gap between fasting and intermittent fasting? I don't think so. Rene and Bonnie are going to be the best to tell you when you have a gap. This is my immunotherapy. I have never had a reflux in my life. My wife is getting pregnant. I was sitting up in the night. It was super weird. Then I said, I can't do anything for you. Rene didn't do anything. I can't do anything for you. Then I made a formula for myself. I think I used it for 2 weeks. It is now 2 years later. I have never had a reflux. The other thing that helps me a lot is to ask Rene if he can get my number because he needs a cancer patient. I am 71 years old. I have been on Nexium all my life. You told me Nexium is bad. I believed you. I didn't believe you. You said it every day. It is gone. I didn't believe you. I said, yes, it is wonderful. It is for me. It is for me. It has been a wonderful time. You came in with a red welcome. This is our medical doctor. He asked if I was sick. A few days later he came back. I am very happy. Tell me, what is the idea? Is it like this? My answer to you is if you want to do carnivore, then do it. I will give you insulin. I call it keto. It is healthy keto. I will write it down for you. I will give you one of the two. 8 people. I think I will do carnivore. Then people will be very happy when they see it. Obviously, when people go out with their friends, it is different. Realize that your body can stop for 4 days to burn fat. Even if it is once a week, you will never lose 15 kilos. We are not so socially active. Realize what I said to myself. I will drink boys. Until my insulin is stabilized. We will die of insulin. It will not be at 64. It is very abnormal. If it is too high, monitor it. If you cheat now, you will get a little confused. People will lose a lot. People are different. They lose a lot of calories. You will not have that problem. Is it not enough? Almost never. That means we are still on this side of the abyss. I am so happy about it. It happens when you wake up in the middle of the day and you don't want to do anything. It is a trend. So far, all you know about insulin is that it is a built-in drug. Skin tag. We are still on this side. Let's talk about our margin. Testosterone. If your insulin is high, you burn through vitamin D and testosterone. I assumed it would be pretty low. Let's talk about it. I know vitamin D will be low. If you want to start exercising, vitamin D is the building block for testosterone. It is not necessary to burn through testosterone. But if you have a reliable source, it is 5% incredible. It is unproven.
