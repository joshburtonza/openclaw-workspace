## The 7 Lego Brick Categories

Every short-form video is made of these 7 pieces. Find winners in your category. Explode their videos into these 7 pieces. Hold what's world-class. Improve what isn't. Restack. Post.

1. **Topic** — What is the video actually about
2. **Angle** — What's the interesting take on that topic (shocking or useful)
3. **Hook structure** — Visual hook + text hook + spoken hook (MUST align)
4. **Story structure** — How is info laid out: case study, breakdown, listicle, personal narrative
5. **Visual format** — Split screen, full screen, circle cam, vlog POV, in-world, etc.
6. **Key visuals** — A-roll, B-roll, graphics, motion overlays
7. **Audio** — Music, sound effects

**The play:** For any given video, topic + angle change. Hook structure, story structure, visual format can hold constant from winners. Don't reinvent until you've mastered the fundamentals.

## Hook = 3 Components (Must All Align)

### 1. Visual Hook (Thumb Stopper)
- **Job:** Stun them. Stop the scroll.
- People see visuals before they read or hear. Speed of light > speed of sound.
- Must be: **High motion. High color. High contrast.**
- Motion: natural > artificial (add zoom-ins or B-roll if no natural motion)
- Different from what they normally see = freeze for a second = in

### 2. Text Hook (Title Text + Captions)
- **Job:** Confirm what the visual means. Set context. Create curiosity gap.
- Title text = big overlay text (not captions). Says what the video is about.
- Captions = spoken words in small text.
- Example: if visual shows a robot with human tendons → title text: "AI robot has human tendons"
- They see the robot, see the text, brains align → "I'm on track. High absorption. Keep going."

### 3. Spoken Hook (First Sentence)
- **Job:** Confirm context, open a question.
- Rules: fewest possible words. Active voice. Max clarity.
- **KPI = absorption rate.** Not fewer words for its own sake — clarity first. Cut fluff. Add words if needed for clarity.
- First sentence must open exactly ONE clear question in the viewer's mind.

### The Golden Rule
All three (visual, text, spoken) MUST SAY THE SAME THING.
Confusion = churn. Comprehension = watch time.

## The Contrast Principle (How You Get Them Curious)

Contrast = the difference between what they expect vs what you show them.

### Direct Contrast (Stronger)
"Most people think X. But actually Y."
- You establish the common belief → then flip it
- Full arc = 200 points (lean to +100, flip to -100)
- Viewer gets curious why their belief was wrong → keeps watching

### Implied Contrast (Weaker)
Wild contrarian statement without establishing the common belief first.
- Viewer must complete the puzzle themselves
- Smaller arc = less pull

**Use direct contrast whenever possible.**

## Story Structure — One Question Chain

The easiest way to audit a script: write line by line and check that:
1. Line 1 opens exactly ONE clear question
2. Line 2 answers it → opens the next question
3. Line 3 answers that → opens next
4. Continue until payoff

No question = no pull. Multiple equal questions = confusion. One question = forward momentum.

**Example:**
- "Google just dropped Gemini 3. It's a crazy AI model." → Question: what can it do?
- "It can [X, Y, Z]." → Question: how do I use it?
- "Go to [link]." → Question: how much does it cost?
- "You can get a free tier here." → DONE

---

## The Angle (Finding What's Interesting)

For every topic, rank on a **Shock Score (0-100)**:
> Out of 100 people in a room, how many would already believe this?

Low number = high shock = strong angle.

Ask: "What do most people believe about this topic that I can flip?"
The further the flip and the faster you can prove it, the stronger the video.

---

## The Two Dopamine Hit Rule

To lock a viewer in, you need **2 hits of dopamine** before they churn.

A dopamine hit = telling them something non-obvious that they can actually use.

- 0 hits → they bounce
- 1 hit → maybe stay
- 2 hits → locked. They'll stay for 20 more because there might be more.

**Target:** Get hit #1 in first 30 seconds. Hit #2 before 60 seconds.

## Short-Form Script Template

```
[VISUAL HOOK]: High motion/color/contrast shot or visual setup
[TITLE TEXT]: One line that matches the visual and the opening statement

[SPOKEN LINE 1 — Context + Contrast]:
"Most people think [COMMON BELIEF]. But [FLIP]."
(opens ONE question)

[LINE 2 — Answer + Next question]:
[Answer] → opens next question naturally

[LINE 3-N — Chain]:
Keep the one-question chain going.

[DOPAMINE HIT #1]: Non-obvious, tactically useful insight
(aim for ~20-30 seconds in)

[DOPAMINE HIT #2]: Second non-obvious, useful insight
(aim for ~45-60 seconds in)

[PAYOFF — Close the loop]:
Don't bait and switch. Answer what you opened.
Last line = single memorable takeaway.
```

## For Josh's Brand (B2B Game = Trust → Offer)

Josh is playing **Content Game 5: B2B** (AI agency services).

Goal = content minutes → trust → intro call → client.

That means:
- **Hyper niche.** Don't go broad to chase views. Chase on-target views.
- **Non-obvious + tactically implementable.** Give them a result they can feel.
- **Personal narrative.** One-of-one stories they can't replicate (retrenchment, agency build, client wins).
- **No entertainment play.** That game is dying by 2028.

Every video = a sales agent working 24/7. One viewer gets 2 dopamine hits → bookmarks → comes back → trusts → books a call.

---

## Format Notes for Josh

- **TikTok/Reels:** 45-75 seconds. Hook in first 3 seconds. 2 dopamine hits. Payoff.
- **YouTube Shorts:** Same structure. Close your eyes test: is the audio pacing right? Not too fast, not too slow.
- **YouTube long-form (future):** 10x content minutes per rep vs shorts. Same Lego bricks, longer rope. Do this when content machine is running.

## Trending Format (Jan 2026)

**Personal narrative driven visual storytelling.**
- Your lived experiences. One-of-one. Can't be copied.
- Structure: "I had this problem → tried X → didn't work → did Y → here's what I learned"
- Shoot in the world (movement, real locations) > static bedroom setup
- Numbered series (e.g. "30 lessons before 30" style) = bingeability hack

This format stays relevant because lived experiences are un-replicable.
