## Today's Log

**Josh:** Okay we were talking about the xport pole - do we do it in a lump sum or in a few saving
**Claude:** Her birthday is May 5 — 68 days away. Two options:

**Lump sum now (R4,500 ish)**
Buy it this week. She gets it early, has it for training before her birthday, and you're not scrambling in April. Downside: cash out now.

**Save R500–700/week**
68 days = ~10 weeks. At R500/week you're at R5,000 by end of April — covers pole + Pleasers. Keeps cash flow lighter while the new clients come on board.

Given you've got two clients potentially signing — I'd wait until at least one of those confirms, then do the lump sum. Gives you a clean "celebration purchase" moment and you won't feel the pinch.

You want me to set a reminder for when to pull the trigger — say mid-April?

### 00:44 SAST — Telegram
**Josh:** But i am also trying to kill our debts as much possible- i believe you have all that data
**Claude:** I don't have your debt data — from my memory notes: "Debt figures not entered by Josh (Finances UI ready and waiting)." The Finances UI exists in Mission Control but you never put the numbers in.

So I'm flying blind on the debt side. I don't know:
- Total debt amount
- What it's owed to (credit cards, bond, personal loans, etc.)
- Monthly minimum payments

**To give you a real answer on pole vs. debt, I need those numbers.**

Two ways to get them into the system:
1. Just tell me now — I'll note it and we can model it
2. Log into Mission Control and fill in the Finances tab

Once I have the debt picture, I can tell you whether R4,500 on the pole meaningfully delays payoff or whether it's basically noise. If it's noise, do the lump sum in April when the new clients confirm. If it's significant, the savings plan makes more sense.

What's the rough debt situation?

### 00:47 SAST — Telegram
**Josh:** Okay we can chat anout this tomorrow
**Claude:** Sounds good. We'll pick it up tomorrow — bring the debt numbers if you can and we'll figure out the best move.

### 00:48 SAST — Telegram
**Josh:** i usually wake up at 6am and check this first thing every morning before anything else
