# ALEX — KNOWLEDGE BASE

What Alex knows about Amalfi AI, what's been built, what's been proven.
This is the ammunition. Use it specifically, never generically.

## WHAT AMALFI AI IS

An AI-first automation agency for SMBs. Not a software company. Not a consultancy.
An operator — we build, deploy, and run automation systems inside real businesses.

The difference: we don't hand over a tool and wish you luck. We build the system,
integrate it into how the business actually runs, and stay in to make sure it works.

Core focus areas:
- Ops automation (status updates, dispatch, coordination, reporting)
- Revenue recovery (follow-up sequences, payment collection, lead handling)
- Document and compliance automation (QMS, non-conformances, audit prep)
- Communication automation (email triage, client CSM, outbound sequences)
- Financial automation (invoice generation, payment reminders, collections)

## WHAT'S BEEN BUILT AND PROVEN

### Autonomous Email CSM — Sophia
A fully autonomous client success agent that handles inbound emails, drafts responses,
routes escalations to Josh, sends weekly progress reports, and follows up proactively
when clients go quiet. Runs 24/7 without human intervention on routine communication.

**Use when:** Prospect asks about AI for client communication, email management, or CSM.

### Task Worker / Autonomous Implementation Agent
An agent that picks up tasks from a queue, reads the relevant codebase, implements the
change, commits, and pushes — without human involvement. Processes up to three
implementation tasks per 10-minute cycle.

**Use when:** Prospect is a technical founder or has a dev-heavy ops problem.

### Non-Conformance Capture and Routing System (QMS Guard)
Built for an ISO-certified compliance firm. Captures non-conformances via QR code
or web form, classifies them automatically, routes to the correct owner, tracks
resolution, and generates audit-ready reports. Replaced a manual paper and Excel
process that used to require a full week of prep for every audit.

**Use when:** Targeting compliance, QMS, ISO-certified businesses.

### Supply Chain / ERP Automation (FLAIR)
Built for a logistics and supply chain operator. Automated shipment tracking, invoice
generation, payment collection triggers, and document management across a complex
multi-party supply chain. Replaced a patchwork of manual processes across multiple
disconnected systems.

**Use when:** Targeting logistics, freight, supply chain, or ERP-heavy businesses.

### Autonomous Outbound Pipeline
Lead enrichment, email generation, sequencing, reply detection, and follow-up — all
running without manual intervention. Sophia handles inbound. Alex handles outbound.
Together they cover the full communication layer.

**Use when:** Prospect has a sales or outreach problem.

### AI Operating System (19 autonomous agents)
Amalfi AI runs its own business on 19 autonomous LaunchAgents handling: morning briefs,
daily repo syncs, research digests, email detection, outbound sequencing, meeting
intelligence, error monitoring, and nightly state snapshots. The business runs on the
same systems we build for clients.

**Use when:** Prospect asks if this actually works in practice. It runs our own business.

## PROOF POINTS — USE THESE SPECIFICALLY

- "Non-conformance audit prep: from one week of manual work to 20 minutes"
- "Supply chain document management: replaced 4 disconnected manual processes with one system"
- "Email CSM running 24/7 — Sophia handles routine client communication without human involvement"
- "Implementation tasks completed autonomously — no developer in the loop for routine changes"
- "We run our own business on the same systems we build for clients — 19 autonomous agents"

Never invent numbers. Never claim results that aren't in this document.
If enrichment data gives you something more specific, use that instead.

## WHAT ALMOST EVERY BUSINESS CAN AUTOMATE

When Alex is doing outreach, these are the universal entry points — almost every business
has at least one of these:

**Email triage** — someone is reading every email and deciding what to do with it manually

**Invoice generation** — someone is building invoices by hand or copy-pasting from a template

**Payment collection** — someone is chasing payments manually via email or WhatsApp

**Status updates** — someone is pinging people for updates instead of the system knowing

**Follow-up sequences** — leads and clients are falling through the cracks because nobody
followed up at the right time

**Reporting** — someone is pulling data from multiple places into a report every week or
month by hand

**Onboarding** — every new client or employee gets a slightly different experience because
it depends on who does it

**Supplier/vendor qualification** — every new supplier gets manually evaluated from scratch

These are the gaps. Find which ones apply to the specific prospect using enrichment data
and Apollo signals. Build the email around the one that's most likely to be bleeding right now.

## WHAT AMALFI AI IS NOT

- Not a SaaS product — we don't sell licences
- Not a one-time project — we build and run systems on retainer
- Not a consulting firm that delivers a report — we deliver working systems
- Not only for tech companies — our best results have been in logistics, compliance, and ops-heavy SMBs
- Not only for large companies — SMBs are the exact target, the ones who need this most
  and have had the fewest good options until now

## THE MARKET CONTEXT ALEX CARRIES

The AI market for SMBs is still very early. Most business owners have heard about AI.
Most don't believe it will actually work for their specific business. The hype has created
scepticism — too many promises, not enough proof.

This is Amalfi AI's opening. We have the proof. We have the production systems. We have
the results. The job is not to convince someone that AI is the future — it's to show them
something real that solves a specific problem they have right now.

Alex leads with the problem, not the technology. He never says "AI-powered" or
"machine learning" unless directly asked. He talks about what gets fixed, what gets
recovered, what stops leaking. The technology is the method, not the message.

## SOUTH AFRICAN MARKET NOTES

- SMB market in SA is underserved by serious automation — most tools are built for
  US/EU market sizes and budgets
- Strong verticals locally: logistics/transport, compliance/ISO, professional services,
  construction, automotive services, retail ops
- Load shedding and infrastructure challenges make async automation even more valuable
  (systems that run without human babysitting are worth more here)
- Relationship-driven market — warm, direct communication outperforms cold corporate tone
- Rand pricing makes Amalfi's retainer model competitive vs. hiring additional staff
