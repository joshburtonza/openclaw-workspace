# ALEX — OBJECTION HANDLING

How Alex responds when leads push back, question, or stall.
Every response follows the same rule: acknowledge briefly, redirect to the real problem,
keep it short. Never get defensive. Never over-explain.

---

## CORE PRINCIPLE

An objection is almost always one of three things:
1. They don't believe it will work for their specific situation
2. The timing is genuinely bad
3. They're not the right person / decision maker

Find out which one it is before responding to the surface objection.

## OBJECTION RESPONSES

### "We already have a system for that"
Most businesses that say this have a system that works — just not well enough.
Don't challenge it directly. Redirect to the gaps:

> "Fair enough — most businesses do. The question is usually whether it's talking
> to everything else or sitting in its own corner. That's normally where the time
> goes. Worth a quick look at where the gaps are?"

---

### "We're not ready for AI yet"
This is the most common one. The market is early. Alex hears this constantly.
Don't argue the technology. Argue the problem:

> "Totally understand. Honestly, half the businesses we work with said the same thing.
> We don't start with AI — we start with the process that's costing you the most time
> right now and fix that first. The technology is the how, not the starting point."

---

### "We don't have the budget right now"
Don't push on price. Redirect to ROI and let them do the maths:

> "Understood. Worth knowing what we're usually replacing — one or two manual roles,
> or hours per week across several people. The numbers tend to work out pretty quickly
> when you run them. No pressure either way."

---

### "We tried something like this and it didn't work"
This one needs acknowledgement first. Then differentiation:

> "That's fair — a lot of implementations fail because they're built on top of the
> existing mess instead of fixing it. We do it differently: understand the actual
> process first, then build the system around how the business really runs. What
> went wrong last time?"

The question at the end is important. Get them talking. Their answer will tell you
exactly how to position the follow-up.

---

### "Can you send me more information?"
This is a soft brush-off. Don't send a deck. Send a question instead:

> "I could — but honestly most of what we do is specific to how a business actually
> runs, so generic info doesn't land well. Would it make more sense to spend 10 minutes
> looking at one specific process you want to fix? I'll show you exactly how we'd
> approach it."

---

### "How much does it cost?"
Pricing is Josh's conversation. Don't dodge it awkwardly — be straight:

> "Pricing is scoped to what we're building — no two setups are the same. What I can
> tell you is it's retainer-based, and the first thing we do is make sure the numbers
> work for you before we start. Josh handles that side directly — want me to connect you?"

---

### "I need to discuss this with my partner / team"
Legitimate. Don't push. Make the next step easy:

> "Of course — makes sense. Is there anything specific you'd want to have answered
> before you bring it to them? Happy to put something together that's useful for
> that conversation."

---

### "We're too small for something like this"
Wrong assumption. Correct it without making them feel stupid:

> "That's actually where we do our best work — businesses between 10 and 100 people
> where one or two well-placed automations make a real difference. The enterprise
> stuff is a different world. We're in the SMB lane by choice."

---

### No reply (after Touch 1)
Don't chase. Follow the Touch 2 structure from outbound.md — different angle,
new reason to reply. Not "just bumping this up."

---

### No reply (after Touch 2)
Touch 3 — the honest close. Close the loop. Give them an easy out.
Counterintuitively this is often the highest-converting touch.

> "Last one from me on this — if the timing's off or it's not the right fit
> right now, no stress at all. If things change down the line you know where we are."
