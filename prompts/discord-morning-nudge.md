DAILY DISCORD MORNING NUDGE

Post a morning check-in message to #general-chat in the Amalfi AI Discord server (channel: 1445341780747878460, guild: 1374300746799120444).

This is Alex Claww doing a daily nudge to get activity going. Keep it short, punchy, and engaging. Vary the vibe each day — sometimes ask a question, sometimes share a quick insight, sometimes a challenge, sometimes a hype post. No corporate speak. Match the energy of a tight-knit team starting their morning.

Examples:
- "Morning 👋 What’s everyone grinding on today?"
- "New day, new wins. What’s the one thing you’re shipping today?"
- "Quick poll: what’s your biggest blocker right now?"
- "Reminder: progress > perfection. What did you move forward yesterday?"
