# Automation Readiness Audit
**Amalfi AI — Paid Discovery Deliverable**

> This audit is a standalone paid engagement (suggested R3,500–R6,500 ZAR depending on business complexity). It is not included in scoping calls. The output document becomes the foundation for any automation proposal. Do not give this away as part of a free discovery session.

---

## Purpose

Before any automation is built, the business must be understood at the process level. This template structures a 60–90 minute interview with the business owner. The output is a written Automation Readiness Report delivered within 5 business days.

Principle: **process documentation precedes automation**. You cannot automate what has not been mapped.

## Section 1 — Service Category Inventory

*Goal: establish all the distinct service lines or operational categories in the business.*

Ask the owner to list every type of work the business does — both client-facing and internal. For each category, estimate monthly volume.

| # | Service / Workflow Category | Monthly Volume | Revenue-Generating? | Frequency |
|---|----------------------------|---------------|---------------------|-----------|
| 1 | | | Yes / No | Daily / Weekly / Monthly / Ad hoc |
| 2 | | | | |
| 3 | | | | |
| 4 | | | | |
| 5 | | | | |
| 6 | | | | |
| 7 | | | | |

**Probe questions:**
- What does a typical week look like from open to close?
- What do you do every single day without fail?
- What takes up the most hours per week?
- What do customers contact you about most frequently?
- What admin work do you hate doing but can't skip?

---

## Section 2 — Current Tools Per Workflow

*Goal: map which tools are being used (or not used) for each workflow. Most SMBs are running on WhatsApp, spreadsheets, and memory.*

For each category from Section 1, document the current tool stack:

| # | Category | Communication Tool | Data Storage | Task Tracking | Notes / Invoicing | Manual Steps |
|---|----------|--------------------|-------------|---------------|-------------------|--------------|
| 1 | | WhatsApp / Email / Call / None | Spreadsheet / Paper / Memory / CRM | WhatsApp / Notepad / None | WhatsApp / Email / Paper / Xero / None | |
| 2 | | | | | | |
| 3 | | | | | | |
| 4 | | | | | | |
| 5 | | | | | | |

**Probe questions:**
- Where does information about this job/client live right now?
- If you weren't here, where would a staff member look to find it?
- When does something fall through the cracks — what does that look like?
- Do you have a CRM? Do you actually use it?
- How do you send quotes / invoices / confirmations?

---

## Section 3 — Workflow Narrative Per Category

*Goal: capture the actual step-by-step process for each key category. Use the trigger → steps → output format.*

Fill one block per workflow. Focus on the top 3–5 workflows from Section 1 (highest volume or highest pain).

---

### Workflow: ___________________

**Trigger** (what kicks this off?)
> e.g. "Customer sends WhatsApp asking for a quote"

**Steps** (what happens next, in order?)
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.

**Output** (what is the end result when it goes right?)
> e.g. "Customer receives quote PDF, books job, deposit paid"

**Failure mode** (what goes wrong and how often?)
> e.g. "Quote sent but no follow-up — customer goes cold. Happens 3–4x per week."

**Who does it?**
> Owner / Staff member (name/role) / Shared

**Time per instance:**
> ___ minutes

**Volume per week/month:**
> ___

---

*(Duplicate this block for each workflow — aim for 3–5 total)*

---

## Section 4 — Owner vs Staff Split Per Task

*Goal: identify which tasks require the owner's direct involvement and which are being done by the owner that could be delegated or automated.*

| Task / Workflow | Currently Done By | Should Be Done By | Blocker to Delegation |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| | Owner / Staff / Both | Owner / Staff / System | No SOP / No trust / No time to train / No tool |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

**Probe questions:**
- Which of these could you hand to a staff member tomorrow if they had a clear process?
- What tasks do you do because no one else knows how?
- What do you do last thing at night or first thing in the morning that no one else touches?
- If you were away for two weeks, what would definitely break?

**Autonomy score (owner-to-system ratio):**
> After filling the table, count: what % of tasks require the owner personally?
> Target for a well-automated SMB: owner personally required for < 30% of operational tasks.

---

## Section 5 — Pain Point Ranking

*Goal: prioritise which workflows to automate first based on pain severity, volume, and automation feasibility.*

Ask the owner to rank each workflow from Section 1 across three dimensions (1 = low, 5 = high):

| Workflow | Pain Severity (1–5) | Volume / Frequency (1–5) | Owner Time Cost (1–5) | Total Score | Notes |
|----------|--------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|-------------|-------|
| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |

**Score interpretation:**
- 12–15: Immediate automation candidate — address in Phase 1
- 8–11: Strong candidate — include in Phase 2 or bundle
- 4–7: Nice-to-have — Phase 3 or only if low build cost
- 1–3: Deprioritise — high effort, low return

**Probe questions:**
- Which of these problems keeps you up at night?
- Which one, if fixed, would have the biggest effect on your revenue?
- Which one causes the most customer complaints?
- Where do you lose money because of inefficiency?

## Audit Debrief Checklist

Before closing the session, confirm:

- [ ] All service categories listed and volumes estimated
- [ ] Tools mapped for each workflow
- [ ] At least 3 workflow narratives captured (trigger → steps → output)
- [ ] Owner vs staff split documented for each major task
- [ ] Pain points scored and top 3 agreed with client
- [ ] Client understands the next step: Automation Readiness Report delivered within 5 business days
- [ ] Follow-on proposal scope discussed (rough — not binding)
- [ ] Deployment sequencing confirmed: Phase 1 automations are internal-only (team-facing). Client-facing or externally accessible automations are scoped as Phase 2 minimum, after internal ROI is demonstrated.

## Deliverable: Automation Readiness Report

The output of this audit is a written report containing:

1. **Business process map** — all workflows documented
2. **Tool gap analysis** — what's missing or redundant in the current stack
3. **Automation opportunity matrix** — ranked list of workflows by ROI
4. **Recommended Phase 1 scope** — 2–3 highest-value automations with rough effort estimates
5. **Owner dependency risk score** — how reliant the business is on the owner for operations

**Deployment sequencing principle:** Phase 1 scope should default to internal-only automations — workflows used by the client's team, not their customers. This is not a limitation; it is the fastest path to demonstrable ROI. Internal-only automations carry no external security exposure, can be iterated without customer impact, and give the business owner confidence in the system before exposing it to their clients. Phase 2 (client-facing automation) should only begin once Phase 1 has been running in production for at least 4 weeks and ROI has been measured.

This report is the basis for any subsequent automation proposal. Do not begin build work without it.
