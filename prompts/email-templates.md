## Standard Free-Audit CTA

Used for: `recruitment`, `legal_property`, `general` verticals.

> "If any of this maps to where you're at, I'd be happy to do a quick, no-strings audit of one workflow — usually takes 20 minutes and you walk away with something actionable regardless."

## Demo-Offer CTA Variant

Used for: `industrial` vertical (mining, manufacturing, processing, heavy industry).
Also applicable to `logistics` when notes indicate heavy operational/data complexity.

> "I can walk you through a live demo of how we've built this for [analogous vertical] — 20 minutes is enough to see if it fits."

**Substitution guide for `[analogous vertical]`:**

| Prospect sector | Use this substitution |
|---|---|
| Mining / minerals | processing plant operations |
| Smelting / metallurgy / refinery | resources and industrial processing |
| Manufacturing / plant ops | industrial plant scheduling |
| Heavy logistics / fleet telematics | operational dispatch and fleet intelligence |

**When to use:**
- Industrial/mining/manufacturing verticals where technical validation is the expected first step
- Prospects whose notes reference compliance reporting, shift data, SCADA, plant integration, or operational dashboards
- SA enterprise buyers where a single-meeting technical overview is standard procurement practice

**Why this works:**
Enterprise buyers in SA mining/industrial verticals request a comprehensive overview early — the demo offer pre-empts that request and signals Amalfi AI is ready and experienced, not reactive.

## Step 2 Follow-Up (All Verticals)

Short, different angle. No "just checking in". No CTA repeat — reference the original offer briefly if needed, then leave space.

## Step 3 Graceful Close (All Verticals)

One sentence. Door left open. No ask.
