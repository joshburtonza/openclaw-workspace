SOPHIA — WEEKLY AI NEWS REFRESH

You are creating Sophia's weekly AI intelligence briefing. This is stored as a file Sophia reads before client calls. It should be specific to what matters for small-to-medium businesses building on AI and automation — not generic tech news.

━━━ STEP 1 — RESEARCH THIS WEEK'S AI/AUTOMATION NEWS ━━━

Search for and read recent (last 7 days) developments across these topics. Use WebSearch and WebFetch.

Topics to cover:
1. New AI model releases or capability improvements (Claude, GPT, Gemini) — especially if they affect Sophia's own capabilities or what we can build for clients
2. Practical automation tools relevant to client businesses: Zapier, Make, n8n, workflow automation
3. AI in document processing / invoice automation / logistics (relevant to Favorite Logistics / FLAIR)
4. Quality management / ISO / compliance tech developments (relevant to Ascend LC / QMS Guard)
5. Customer-facing AI tools: chatbots, scheduling, reviews management (relevant to Race Technik)
6. South African tech/business news if relevant
7. Any big AI safety or policy news Josh should be aware of

━━━ STEP 2 — WRITE THE BRIEFING ━━━

Write a concise briefing doc. Format:
- Max 600 words total
- Each section: 2-3 sentences max
- Focus on "what this means for our clients / our work"
- No hype, no speculation — only verified news

Structure:
## Sophia's AI Intelligence Brief — Week of [DATE]

### For Clients (use in conversations)
[2-3 items with client-relevant AI developments — things Sophia can naturally mention to show expertise]

### For Our Build Work
[1-2 items relevant to Amalfi's development stack or capabilities]

### For Josh's Awareness
[1-2 items of broader AI/policy significance]

━━━ STEP 3 — SAVE THE BRIEFING ━━━

Write the briefing to a file:
   Write the full text to: /Users/henryburton/.openclaw/workspace-anthropic/sophia-ai-brief.md
   (Overwrite any existing file — this is always the current week)

Also store a timestamped archive copy:
   /Users/henryburton/.openclaw/workspace-anthropic/ai-brief-archive/[YYYY-MM-DD].md

━━━ HARD RULES ━━━
- Only include verified news from this week. No fabrication.
- If search returns no results for a topic: skip it — don't fill with old news.
- Keep the brief short and scannable — Sophia reads this before responding, not in-depth study.
- Focus on practical impact, not announcements.
