# Retainer Pitch — Project-to-Retainer Conversion

**Trigger:** project client has been active for 60+ days with `retainer_status = 'project_only'`
in `data/client-projects.json`. Generated by `email-response-scheduler.sh` and queued for
Josh's approval before sending.

**Source:** Meeting: The Future — feast/famine project revenue is the primary structural risk
for boutique AI agencies. Recurring retainer conversion is the fix.

## Framing Principle

This email is NOT a sales pitch. It is a responsible handover warning.

The client has been running live automation for 60+ days. The question is not
"would you like to keep working with us?" but "what happens to your system when the
project engagement ends?" The answer to that question is the pitch.

**Loss-aversion beats upsell every time.** A client who has invested 60+ days into
a working system does not want to lose it. The email makes that cost concrete.

## Subject Line Formula

Use one of these — pick based on what feels most honest for the client:

- "Before [project name] wraps — what stays vs. what stops"
- "After [project name] goes live — here's what needs a home"
- "[Project name] is running — here's what keeps it that way"

Do NOT use: "Upgrade", "Take things to the next level", "Exciting opportunity", "I wanted to reach out"

## Email Structure

### 1. Open with what is currently live (concrete anchor)

State the work as a fact, not a pitch. Lead with specifics — number of automations,
what they replaced, what they are currently doing. No pleasantries.

Formula: "Hi [Name] — [project name] has been live for [X days/weeks]. Here's what's
currently running for your team: [3-4 specific automations or features]."

### 2. What stops when the project ends (loss-aversion core — this is the pitch)

List exactly what breaks or regresses when the project engagement closes and there is
no ongoing support. Be specific, technical, and factual. Do NOT be vague.

Structure each item as a specific failure mode:
- "[Automation X] needs ongoing monitoring — without it, [specific breakdown] happens"
- "[Integration Y] will break when [vendor/API/system] changes (this happens on average every [timeframe])"
- "[Process Z] will revert to the manual workflow it replaced — [hours/week] back on the team"
- "[Feature W] will accumulate bugs and drift without active maintenance"

Keep to 3-4 items max. Each must be credible and client-specific.

### 3. What a retainer covers (one short paragraph — no sales language)

Frame the retainer as "keeping the system alive and improving over time", not as
buying additional services. Do not list tiers, packages, or features.

Example: "A monthly retainer means we stay in the system — monitoring, fixing, improving,
and handling the inevitable edge cases before they become problems. The system keeps
running the way it does today."

### 4. Single ask

One question, one action. A 30-minute call to discuss what ongoing support would look like.
Not "don't let the project end." Not "ready to sign up?" Just: would a call make sense?
